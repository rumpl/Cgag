The Google gag library written in C#

For more info see: http://code.google.com/p/gag
Or you can see the awesome (i really like the background color) official project page : http://rumpl.github.com/Cgag/

Missing features :
- Pretty much everything in the "enforceable" namespace.

Example :

using Cgag.Attributes.Disclaimer;

/* code code code */

[BossMadeMeDoIt]
public void WorkOnWeekends()
{
  /* ... */
}

And of course, it's on Nuget now : http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Cgag
